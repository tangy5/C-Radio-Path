"""DINOv2 backbone module.

This module provides DINOv2 implementations for the TAO PyTorch framework.
DINOv2 is a self-supervised learning method that learns robust visual features
without supervision. It extends the Vision Transformer architecture with additional
components for improved feature learning.

The DINOv2 architecture was introduced in "DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features
without Supervision" by Oquab et al. This implementation extends the Vision Transformer
to provide additional functionality for backbone integration and feature extraction.

Key Features:
- Self-supervised learning without labels
- Robust visual feature learning
- Support for register tokens for enhanced representation
- SwiGLU activation functions for improved performance
- Multiple model sizes (Large, Giant)
- Integration with TAO backbone framework
- Support for activation checkpointing and layer freezing
- Flexible image size handling

            - freeze_norm (bool): Freeze normalization layers. Default: `False`

    Returns:
        DINOV2: Configured DINOv2 ViT Giant model.

    Example:
        >>> model = vit_giant_patch14_reg4_dinov2_swiglu(num_classes=1000)
        >>> x = torch.randn(1, 3, 518, 518)
        >>> output = model(x)  # Shape: (1, 1000)

    Note:
        This model has approximately 1.1B parameters and is the largest DINOv2
        model with register tokens for enhanced representation learning.
