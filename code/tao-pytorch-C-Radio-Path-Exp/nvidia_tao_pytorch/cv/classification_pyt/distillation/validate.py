"""KNN-based validation for distillation training.

Top-1 evaluation using k Nearest Neighbors.

This consists in the following steps:
- on each rank, run model through a shard of the training split of the
  evaluation dataset and collect visual embeddings and labels.
- gather embeddings from all ranks; for ImageNet-1k, this is ~1.2M
  embeddings in total and each rank gets its own copy
  (NOTE: this may not scale to bigger evaluation datasets!)
- on each rank, for each batch of the sharded validation split of the
  evaluation dataset:
  - measure similarity between training and validation embeddings
  - extract top-K similarities (K elements per item in the validation batch)
  - extract classes associated with top-K elements
  - extract top class prediction using a weighted majority vote.
  - compare against ground truth and calculate accuracy.

The functions below are designed to plug into Lightning hooks:

- ``build_knn_index``  → call from ``on_validation_epoch_start``
- ``knn_eval_batch``   → call from ``validation_step``
- ``knn_eval_end``     → call from ``on_validation_epoch_end``
