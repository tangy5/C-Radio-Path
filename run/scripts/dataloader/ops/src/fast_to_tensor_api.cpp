 * PYBIND11 entry point for the FastToTensor C++ extension.
 *
 * Exposes:
 *   fast_to_tensor_cpu(input: Tensor) -> Tensor
 *     Fused cast+normalize: HWC uint8 -> CHW float32 in [0,1].
 *     Single pass over the image data, processing 4 pixels per iteration
 *     using SSE4/AVX2 SIMD intrinsics on x86_64.
 *
 *   is_available() -> bool
 *     Returns true on x86_64 (SIMD kernel compiled), false otherwise.
 *     The Python wrapper checks this to decide whether to use the C++
 *     path or fall back to pure-Python.
