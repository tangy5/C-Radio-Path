"""Frequency-based sample weight injection via SQLite hash database.

Queries a precomputed hash-counts SQLite database to look up how often
each sample appears in the dataset, then injects a ``__weight__`` field
into the sample dict.  Downstream consumers (e.g. ``WeightedWSWoRReservoir``
inside ``MultiPipeSampler``) use these weights for balanced sampling.

    For every batch of ``batch_size`` samples drawn from the upstream
    pipeline, the injector extracts a key (typically an MD5 hash) from
    each sample's metadata, queries the SQLite database for occurrence
    counts, computes a weight via ``weight_fn(count)``, and stores it
    in ``sample['__weight__']``.

    Args:
        database: Path to the SQLite database or an existing connection.
        key_extractor: Callable that maps a sample dict to its database key.
        weight_mode: How to convert counts to weights.  One of
            ``'inv_frequency'``, ``'inv_sq_frequency'``, ``'inv_log_frequency'``,
            ``'none'``/``'uniform'``.
        batch_size: Number of samples to query at once (for efficiency).
